# DESSRT

Based on the social drinking app Untappd, DESSRT is a full-stack web application aimed at dessert lovers. The app was built using Ruby on Rails and postgresSQL on the backend, with Redux serving as a state container for React.js on the frontend.

## Features and Implementation

### Desserts
  Through the dessert form component, users are able to add new desserts to the database. The desserts table consists of columns for name, type, origin, ratings, and an avatar image. Amazon Web Services hosting was used as a remote asset management system to allow for large image uploads. Upon submission of the dessert form, an API call is made to store the dessert in the database. On success, the dessert form reroutes the user directly to the dessert profile page, which displays the dessert information. As users checkin to the dessert, database associations with users and checkins are leveraged to calculate statistics for each dessert, such as average rating, number of checkins and number of unique users, which are displayed on the dessert profile page.

### Checkins

  On the database level, checkins join the users table and the desserts table. Through the checkin form on each dessert view page, users can upload an image, write a comment, and rate the dessert. Checkin items are mapped into a checkin feed component which is nested in the main presentational components of the app. On each checkin item Database level associations are utilized to display the name and profile image of both the user and dessert as links. The database association between users and checkins is also leveraged to restrict deleting functionality to the checkin author.

  Checkin form displayed as a modal on the dessert profile page:

### Users

  The landing page directs users to either the sign in form or sign up form, both of which are rendered by a single presentational component. Upon registration, user passwords are stored in the database as encrypted hashes produced by BCrypt. Session tokens are also randomly generated and stored in the user's cookies at the start of a new session. Backend validations require users to be signed in to access the app. Signed in users can update their accounts via the account settings form, which dispatches an API call to patch the newly inputted information to the database. Users can view other profiles, and create and view desserts and checkins as well. Users are also able to delete checkins they have created.


## Future Directions for the Project

### Search

  I plan to implement search functionality that will allow users to look for a specific dessert or user. Search will be nested in the Nav Bar and will reroute to a search results page displaying an index of links to the results of the database query. If no results are found there will be a link to the add new dessert form on the results page.

### Friendships

  With the friendships feature users will be able to add friends and curate their profile feed with posts only made by friends.

### Badges

  Users will earn badges for checking in to desserts. This feature is aimed at increasing user engagement and further motivating users to track their activity on the app.
